Simulator for global job schedulers on supercomputers. This C++ application was designed and 
developed as my master's thesis. It uses live status data of parallel computers and 
simulates the future schedule of all currently queued jobs. JuFo is used as job start-time
prediction and scheduler analysis tool for system administrators.
