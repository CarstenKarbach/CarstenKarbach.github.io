An Android app for learning vocabulary. You can add your own list of dictionaries to learn. 
Each word mapping is saved in a card. The cards are organized in card boxes. You can test yourself. 
If your answers are right, the cards are placed in upper boxes, otherwise they are moved downward.
It makes heavy use of both explicit and implicit intents. Unit tests are based on Robolectrict,
the app uses ListFragment, NavUtils, the search bar and a customized view for card boxes.
