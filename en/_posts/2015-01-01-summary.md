# About Me

<p class="longtext">

I am a Software Developer with detailed knowledge of object oriented design, applied software architecture
and design patterns. I am technical lead of a web application development team implementing administration tools.
Furthermore, my work covers contributions to international projects regarding user administration and monitoring software for
supercomputers. These projects cover the development of distributed, platform-independent applications
in multiple programming languages such as Java, PHP, JavaScript, C and C++.
They allow for hands-on experience with agile development, test automation,
continuous integration and revision control. 

All aspects from requirements analysis, modeling, documentation, test development and implementation are part of my daily work.
With that I gain deep knowledge on data protection and security, software licenses and project management. Studying, experimenting with modern technologies and frameworks as well as sharing knowledge and solving complex problems is what I like best about my profession.

<p class="longtext">
<br/>
I received my master's degree in Technomathematics with overall 
grade <span class="ita">very good</span> consecutive to the bachelor's degree in Scientific Programming, 
which is coupled with a parallel apprenticeship.
<br/>
After graduating from school in 2007 I started my professional education as <span class="ita">Mathematical and Technical
Software Developer</span>, which is a parallel apprenticeship connected with the study course Scientific
Programming. During this three-year education students spent about half their time studying a combination
of computer science and mathematics. The second half is dedicated to applying skills from the study
in practical work at the involved companies. Concluding with my bachelor's thesis about the <span class="ita">Design of a 
webinterface for LLview</span> I received my bachelor's degree and completed the apprenticeship in 2010.
In the following two years I studied Technomathematics, which provides advanced knowledge in computer
science with courses such as distributed systems, scientific visualization and image processing.
After writing my master's thesis on a <span class="ita">simulator for job schedulers on supercomputers</span>
I received my master's degree and started working as a Software Developer in 2012. An overview on the
various projects I have been contributing to since then can be found in the following section.
