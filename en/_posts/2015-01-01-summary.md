# About Me

<p class="longtext">

I am a senior backend developer working on the implementation of REST APIs and full-stack web applications in Python, 
PHP, Kotlin and JavaScript. I have in-depth knowledge of the Python frameworks FastAPI, Flask, 
SQLAlchemy as ORM middleware and PHP/Laravel.
Deployment and monitoring of scaling backend systems with flexible system configuration via Docker 
using MariaDB, Redis, Traefik and Nginx are part of my activities.
In doing so, I gain a wide range of experience in the design, architecture, development, 
testing, maintenance and operation of backend software in 
varied projects at an app agency.
I use agile methods, code reviews on a daily basis,
automated tests, continuous integration and version management with git.

<br/>
I received my master's degree in Technomathematics with overall 
grade <span class="ita">very good</span> consecutive to the bachelor's degree in Scientific Programming, 
which is coupled with a parallel apprenticeship.
<br/>
After graduating from school in 2007 I started my professional education as <span class="ita">Mathematical and Technical
Software Developer</span>, which is a parallel apprenticeship connected with the study course Scientific
Programming. During this three-year education students spent about half their time studying a combination
of computer science and mathematics. The second half is dedicated to applying skills from the study
in practical work at the involved companies.
