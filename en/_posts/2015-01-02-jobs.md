# Work experience

<p class="longtext">
Since 2020 I have been working for an app agency as a Backend and Android developer 
in many exciting projects.
Before that, I developed full-stack web applications at the JÃ¼lich Supercomputing Center for the application, 
and review of computing time projects in PHP and JavaScript.
In 2012 I completed my Master's degree in Technomathematik, a combination of applied computer science and 
mathematics.
